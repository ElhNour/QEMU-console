You will code the beginning of a console shell, on the 
serial line UART0. Upon startup, clear the screen, with
the cursor at the top-left corner.

Answer: In order to clear the screen, with the cursor at the top-left corner, I added the instruction "uart_send_string(UART0,"\033[2J\033[0;0H")" before the two first prints (Quit and Hello world), where "\033[2J" clears the whole screen, and "\033[0;0H" moves the cursor to the top-left corner.

The console introduces a command line behavior, like a 
regular shell. That is, the ability to edit a line before 
hitting "return", using the left and right arrow, 
and the backspace or delete keys.

Once you have the ability to read an entire edited line,
when "return" is hit, you can introduce the parsing of that
line. First commands to parse:

  - the command "reset" that clears the entire screen,
    leaving the cursor at the top-left corner.
  - the command "echo" that echoes the rest of the line.     

You will keep a history of the last 20 lines entered,
using up and down arrows to scroll through the history,
on the current line, like a regular shell would do.
